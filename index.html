        Hi! I am Jodi Sauld-Draper. I have been a practicing Licensed Massage
        Therapist in the Abbotsford area since 2014. But, my passion for massage
        began when I was only 6 years old after trying to help my best when I
        was only 6 years old after trying to help my best friend's mom got
        relief from her vericose veins by massaging her legs. Whether it was her
        praise or just the satisifaction of helping someone feel better,
        something lit the fire inside and I wanted to help others. Massage
        wasn't a popular career path back when I graduated highschool. So, I
        went on to attend college, which proved not to be my forte. So, I began
        my career in retail and worked my way into management. After 20 years, I
        had exhausted my passion and found myself struggling to enjoy work life.
        I was worn out and depleted. I needed a change not only peace of mind,
        but for my two boys. They deserved a Mom with the patience and energy to
        give them the love and support they deserved. So, I decided it was time
        to feed my soul, not just my bank account. So, here I am.
      </p>
