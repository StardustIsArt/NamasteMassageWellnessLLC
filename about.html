        <p>
          Hi! I am Jodi Sauld-Draper. I have been a practicing Licensed Massage
          Therapist in the Abbotsford area since 2014. But, my passion for
          massage began when I was only 6 years old after trying to help my best
          when I was only 6 years old after trying to help my best friend's mom
          got relief from her vericose veins by massaging her legs. Whether it
          was her praise or just the satisifaction of helping someone feel
          better, something lit the fire inside and I wanted to help others.
          Massage wasn't a popular career path back when I graduated highschool.
          So, I went on to attend college, which proved not to be my forte. So,
          I began my career in retail and worked my way into management. After
          20 years, I had exhausted my passion and found myself struggling to
          enjoy work life. I was worn out and depleted. I needed a change not
          only peace of mind, but for my two boys. They deserved a Mom with the
          patience and energy to give them the love and support they deserved.
          So, I decided it was time to feed my soul, not just my bank account.
          So, here I am.
